SwitchyOmega
============

A proxy extension for Chromium.

Development status
==================

## PAC Generation
A prototype of generating PAC from profiles is done. Run pac_gen_test.dart or compile it to generate a sample PAC file.

## UI
A basic UI structure of SwitchyOmega options page (without profile settings) is available. See options/options.html.

**Note: You need to load SwitchyOmega as a Chromium extension for the English locale to work.** Otherwise, you will see an empty page without any text.

## Development Schedule

See the [development schedule on the wiki](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/wiki/Development-schedule).
